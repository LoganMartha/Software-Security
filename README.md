# Software-Security

In this project, I was to use my knowledge of software secuity to implement a safe communication between server and user for a client application.  In order to maintina its security, I made sure to include a lot of error handling and ensuring it follows secure coding practices.  In this particular project, I felt the error handling was a smoother implementation than what I have done in the past.  Taking this course, with its focus on security, has impproved those apsects of my development skills and knowledge.  Readability and code comments explaining the code is an area in this project specifically that I could improve on.  This will allow for easier updates if needed in the future.  Overall, I believe the concentration on security has added more tools to my toolbox that I will be able to implement in future projects.
