Questions to Answer:

1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

**Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers.  The client, Artemis Financial wanted help modernizing their operations.  They specifically asked from us, to help implement the most current and effective      software security.  Their main goal is to make sure that their client's data and financial information is safe and secure.**
   
2. What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
   
**One of the vulnerabilities I noticed was lack of error handling.  Making sure only the correct information is taken into the server is a great way in avoiding and suspicious data being implemented.  Coding securely is a huge component in making sure the data being     distributed is secure and safe from attackers.  Making sure that they have a secure software will allow for great opportunities their overall wellbeing.  In essence, it should promote better business as they are a reliable and safe option in this business space.**
   
3. What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

**When it came to the assessment, making sure that all of the vulnerabilities were handled was the biggest challenge.  Making sure the code was clean and secure through all vulnerabilities was a huge component of the work put in.**
  
4. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

**The main way we increased security is using an encrypted cipher in order to keep the data secure.  Implementing this allows the server and client to directly pass information, but in a encrypted manner.  So, if any form of interception from an attacker may occur,        actually understanding the data the received will be nearly impossible.  In the future, when assessing and vulnerabilities, understanding the needs of the client is super important when deciding what mitigation techniques to use.  For example, if the data being            transferred is super private, making sure the communication between server/client is super secure.**
   
5. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

**Making sure to constantly test and provide dependency checks on the software allowed us to make sure the code was functional and secure.  This would also allow us to see if new vulnerabilities were introduced.**
   
6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

**Learning about different ciphers is something I can see myself implementing in future projects.  If there is sensitive information within a project, making sure it is secure is important.  A cipher can help aid in that.**
  
7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

**I think future employers will be able to see my attention to detail in this assignment.  Making sure your code is safe and secure is an underappreciated skill that needs to be on the for-front, in my opinion.**
